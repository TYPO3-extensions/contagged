	  (new parameter "stripBlockTags" for replacing <p>...</p> with <br/> in long description;
	  thanks to Markus Timtner)
	* CHG Changed stdWrap in TS configuration to preStdWrap and added postStdWrap to make a outerWrap possible
	* ADD Maximum amount of occurancies to be tagged can be configured for each type of term (e.g. "plugin.tx_contagged.types.dfn_block.maxOccur = 1")
